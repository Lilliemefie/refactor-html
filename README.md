# Refactoring Existing Code

The purpose of this refactoring is to improve the existing code of the clientâ€™s website without changing how it looks and what it does. The key to refactoring is to make it readability, accessibility, and clean. Once the code is clean, it will be easy to update or put news features to the existing code. 

#### You can check out the finished refactoring website here: [https://lilliemefie.github.io/refactor-html](https://lilliemefie.github.io/refactor-html/)


## How to improve?
-	Using the right semantic and nescessary HTML elements
-	Make CSS Stylesheet short but functional 
-	Input the matching text with the website products/services to be optimized for search engines 
-   Make all the links usable
